# ComplexNetworks25

This repository contains the practical assignments for the Analysis of Complex Networks course, which is part of the [Master's Degree in Fundamental Principles of Data Science](https://mat.ub.edu/sciencedata/) offered by the University of Barcelona.


- **Course and Semester:** 2024-25, spring semester.
- **Authors:** [Marc Ballestero Rib√≥](https://github.com/srmarcballestero), [Arnau Jutglar Puig](https://github.com/arnauJutglar).

## Contents

The project consists of an exploration of the [European Air Transport Multiplex Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01344), a multiplex network of airline routes among European airports, where each of the 37 edge types represents routes by a different airline.

In brief, we perform the following analyses:
- **Microscale Analysis**: computation of centrality measures.
- **Macroscale Analysis**: study of degree distributions, peripheries, transitivity, etc.
- **Mesoscale Analysis**: community detection using greedy modularity maximization, the Louvain algorithm and the Girvan-Newman algorithm.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: simulation of diffusive random walks and study of the correlation with centrality measures, simulation of a Kuramoto model in the network.
- **Multiplex Representation**: experiments with multiplex representations of the network.
